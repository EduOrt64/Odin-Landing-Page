This has been such a very fun project for me. It has given me a deep understanding about how flex works. 

Just keep an eye on how flex works and you will be always sure about the movements or changes you are making.

if you have problems visualizating your boxes, one thing that helped me a lot was to put a solid border with color to the containers i was going to work in. This way i was able to see what was really going on and the changes i was implementing, instead of doing randomly things.

i will let the whole files in my repos, if you have doubts and think i could help, just contact me and i will be so happy to give a hand.
